# AutoGenerator-Selenium-Commands
This is a syntax generator for the selenium library, this is for people who are starting in the world of scrapping, the tool is in spanish, mostly because I doubt that no one sees this, but I was excited to upload it, is my first little touch with Flet.

commands: pip install flet, undetected-chromedriver, selenium
(if NOT working) : replace pip by pip3 or python -m pip or python3 -m pip

IM WORKING ON THIS::::
